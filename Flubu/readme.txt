- Buildscript project must target .net framework 4.6 or greater.
- update buildscript.cs as necesary.
- run "flubu.exe" for default target or "flubu.exe '{targetName}'" for specific build target. 
- optionaly you can copy Flubu.exe and BuildScript.cs to root directory of the solution and add BuildScript.cs as link to BuildScript project(where flubu is referenced).
- You can found detailed example of how flubu is used at https://bitbucket.org/mzorec/flubuexample/src
