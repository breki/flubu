- problem with NuGet packages in user repository - the paths are too long
	- possible solutions: 
		- the repo path overriden by environment variable?
		1. use different path for user repository
			- optional if the user repository path is already too long?
			- fallback mechanism with different directory candidates:
				- user directory
				- c:\nuget
		2. rename packages?

- fix speech for Win 10 - it is too slow

- add Flubu license to package
- add licenses to 3rd party stuff
	 - include it in nuget package, too
	 - add readme in nuget package on how to correct the build script after updating nuget

- add help target which displays target dependencies
