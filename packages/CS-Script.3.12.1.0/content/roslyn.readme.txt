NOTE: There are two very distinctive use-cases of Roslyn integration with CS-Script:

* CS-Script stand alone executables (e.g. cscs.exe) use Roslyn compiler platform v1.1.0.51202 binaries for handling C#6.0 syntax. The binaries are hosted by the script engine via CSSCodeProvider.v4.6.dll code provider.
The Roslyn binaries are distributed via downloadable release packages from GitHub or via the latest CS-Script Chocolatey package. These Roslyn binaries are the only stable Roslyn distro available at the time. 

* CSScriptLibrary class library uses Roslyn scripting binaries v1.2.0.51211 (beta) for handling C#6.0 syntax when hosting the script engine. These binaries are not included into CS-Script deployment and only distributed via NuGet packages 'CS-Script' and 'CS-Script.bin'.
These pre-release Roslyn binaries are the only adequate Roslyn distro available at the time.
